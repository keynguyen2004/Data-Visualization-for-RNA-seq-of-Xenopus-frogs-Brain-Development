### Background information
*Xenopus*, commonly known as the clawed frog, is a genus of highly aquatic frogs native to sub-Saharan Africa that is genetically surprisingly similar to humans. Among the 20 species that is currently described within the *Xenopus* genus, the two best-known species of this genus are *Xenopus laevis* and *Xenopus tropicalis* - the former of which is used in this project - and has long been used to study developmental and cell biology, and is an increasingly important model for human birth defects and disease, genomics, proteomics and toxicology.

### Project goal
We're looking at the gene expression of the *Xenopus laevis*'s midbrain region at different developmental stages. Particularly, we wanted to perform data visualization techniques to "represent" those different developmental stages and identify the differentially expressed genes between the middle and late developmental stages 


### Data Visualization techniques
Data visualization allow us to comprehend the data as well as extract insightful trend, knowledge, and pattern from it, especially from 250,000+ datapoints. For this project, we'll use the following data visualizations techniques:

1. Boxplot:
2. PCA:
3. Volcano Plot:
4. Heatmap: 

### Results
